Were I to start my site again, I'd probably base it off the prose.io [starter](https://github.com/prose/starter) project.  It includes prose-specific configuration - meaning you don't have to add this configuration after the fact.

One caveat about prose: If you have started a new file, you will lose your work if you click on the prose.io icon to browse the About link or hit the browser's back button.  Ask me how I know.  This is the second time I've typed this article in prose.io.  So be sure to click on the Save icon.  I've chimed in on an existing issue about this.
